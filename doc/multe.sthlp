{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:multe} computes five estimates of treatment effects in settings with multiple treatments and provides estimates of contamination bias. See the package README at {browse "https://github.com/gphk-metrics/stata-multe/blob/main/README.md":github.com/gphk-metrics/stata-multe} for a detailed description and examples.

{pstd}
Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (default) and heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors that treat the treatment propensity scores as known (oracle) are also reported; standard errors can be clustered via {opt cluster()}. Each unique value of the {it:treatment} variable is taken as a distinct level of the treatment. The lowest value of {it:treatment} is picked to be the control group. The {cmd:stratum()} variables can be numeric or string, but should define a series of categories. Finally, the estimates are also reported for an "overlap" sample, which drops covariates that have no variation within a treatment level as well as observations from stratum that do not contain at least one observation from each treatment level. Unlike the full sample, all estimates are identified in the "overlap" sample.

{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Command Options}

{phang}{opth treatment(varname)} Specifies the name of the treatment variable. Each value is taken as a different reatment level.

{phang}{opth stratum(varname)} Not optional if no covariates are specified. This can be any variable, and each value is taken to define a stratum. If any level does not have all values of the treatment, those observations are dropped in the overlap sample.

{phang}{opth cluster(varname)} Clustering covariate.

{phang}{opt cw_uniform} For the CW estimator, should the target weighting scheme give all comparisons equal weight (default), or should it draw from the marginal empirical treatment distribution (if specified)?

{phang}{opth mata:save(str)} supplies an alternative name for the mata structure which stores all estimates and variables in mata (default name is "multe_results"). Note this is in addition to results stored in {cmd:e()}; see {it:{help multe##results:stored results}} below for details.
