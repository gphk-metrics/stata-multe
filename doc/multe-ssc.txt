Title: Multiple Treatment Effects regression with saturated group control
Description:

Given a multi-valued treatment, a saturated group variable (or a varlist which will be used to create a single, saturated group variable) within which treatment is as-good-as-randomly assigned, and a dependent variable, multe computes equal-weighted (ATE), variance-weighted, efficiently-weighted treatment effects estimates and contamination bias decomposition as in Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2022).
